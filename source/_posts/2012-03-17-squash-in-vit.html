It requires Power, Stamina and good judgement. In my school life, I used to play squash and table tennis almost every evening. But when I joined VIT University, here the squash court was under construction. So I haven't played it in two and a half years.<br /><br />Finally the court has been completed. It has a centralized cooling system.<br />It looks great.<br />It feels great.<br /><br />Now time to get my squash racket from home and burn some fat \m/</div></div>
