<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Now I am in the sixth semester of BTech Computer Science Engineering at VIT University.<br /><div>This semester I have taken a course named "Internet and Web Programming". Since I have some decent experience in Web programming already, I am looking forward to this course.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is under FEP. FEP is Faculty Empowerment Program. Under this scheme, the faculty is free to design his own Examination and Grading structure. This means less exams in which I have to mug up and vomit! :)<br /><br /></div><div>So, For Internet and Web Programming course, I have to do a mini project, make a video tutorial and maintain a blog among other things. Since I already have a blog, I'l continue with this one. I am supposed to update 5 blog posts per month.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Hopefully this will help me overcome my laziness and make me a regular blogger!</div></div></div>
