<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This year on 3rd and 4th March, The department of Computer Science Engineering of IIT Chennai organized a technical festival named <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/exebit/site/" target="_blank">Exebit 2012</a>.<br />Students from IIT Chennai had come to my college and were making classroom announcements to promote their fest. They were planning to conduct many interesting workshops and events.<br /><br />I was interested in one particular event, the <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/exebit/site/?q=node/25" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>. So I decided to participate along with 3 friends in a team of 4.<br /><br />The hackathon was a 2-day coding event. It started on Saturday morning. First, we were given an introduction to three open source projects - <a href="http://www.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE</a>, <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/" target="_blank">MediaWiki</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>. After that we were given a list of bugs in each of these projects. The team that solves the maximum/toughest bugs wins.<br /><br />We were relatively new to all of the three projects. Solving KDE bugs would require knowledge of C++, MediaWiki of object oriented Php and Django of Python.<br />We were having some trouble in setting up the KDE environment and as 2 of us knew Php well, we decided to try our hand at solving MediaWiki bugs. It took us quite some time to understand how the MediaWiki framework works and what are Extensions, Hooks, Special Pages etc. Then we started coding.<br />We spent the whole night coding in lab. I didnot sleep for those 2 days! Early morning, we went for a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/parasnarang/status/176114710633119744" target="_blank">walk in the campus</a>. We played basketball early in the morning. Then back to coding after breakfast. The other teams were working hard too. By evening, we were able to find solutions to 6 bugs. In the end we had to give presentations on our bug patches and after some time the winners were announced.<br /><br />We won the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/exebit-hackathon/browse_thread/thread/1870a0ba7ce6846" target="_blank">first prize</a>! We were really happy. Not only because of the cash prize but also because it was our first experience at solving bugs in open source projects and we managed to win!<br /><br />Some facebook updates from my team: [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/parasnarang/posts/10150550117627563" target="_blank">one</a>] [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/freako2011/posts/3007331375826" target="_blank">two</a>] [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/madhumita.sk/posts/2464928242857" target="_blank">three</a>] [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=314991361891147&amp;id=100001408564659" target="_blank">four</a>]</div></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Winners of Hackathon at Exebit2012, IIT Chennai!
