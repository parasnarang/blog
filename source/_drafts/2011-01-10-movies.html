I love watching movies. Recently, as you all know, The Social Network has created a lot of hype in the social media.<br />The Social Network is mainly about how Facebook came into being. It is based on a Novel <strong>The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal</strong> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/benmezrich">Ben Mezrich</a>. Most of my friends appreciate the movie as well as the book. Yes, It is inspiring is some ways but let me warn you that the story is not entirely true. As Mark Zuckerberg puts it in an interview "The only thing they got right were the colours of my T-shirts. I think I actually owned some of them." HaHa!!</div>
